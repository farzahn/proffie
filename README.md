2. Set Up Libraries: Install the Proffieboard libraries from the official repository.
3. Configure Settings: Modify configuration files on the MicroSD card to set up your desired features and settings.
4. Upload Code: Connect the Proffieboard to your computer via USB and upload your custom code.

### Example Code

```cpp
#include <ProffieOS.h>

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    // Initialize Proffieboard settings
    Proffieboard.begin();
}

void loop() {
    // Main loop code
    Proffieboard.update();
}
```

## Troubleshooting
